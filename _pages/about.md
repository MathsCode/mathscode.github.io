<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Jiaming Xu (许珈铭), a third year Ph.D student supervised by [Prof. Guohao Dai (戴国浩)](https://dai.sjtu.edu.cn/pepledetail.html?id=218) in School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University ([上海交通大学计算机学院](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/)) and Shanghai Innovation Institute ([上海创智学院](https://www.sii.edu.cn/)). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2023 from School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University ([西安电子科技大学计算机科学与技术学院](https://cs.xidian.edu.cn/)) supervised by [Prof. Nannan Wang (王楠楠)](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/nnwang/). I was once an intern in Infinigence AI ([无问芯穹](https://cloud.infini-ai.com/platform/ai)) and now still collaborate closely with Xiuhong Li ([李秀红](https://www.zhihu.com/people/hong_pku)) in Infinigence AI.

My research focuses on efficient machine learning systems (MLSys), primarily the effcient AI (e.g., LLM, sparse computing, embodied AI, multimodal model) inference through algorithm (e.g., quantization, pruning, speculative decoding) and system (kernel design, memory management, dataflow design, heterogeneous computing) co-deisgn. I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international conferences and journals such as IEEE TCAD, ISCA, MLSys, DAC.

# 👥 Team
Now I lead the system team (DAI-Sys) in our lab. Our team currently consists of 9 students, including 4 Ph.D. students, 1 master student, and 4 undergraduates. I am very happpy to cooperate with them. <span style="color: red;">I am looking for students, who are excited to tackle efficiency problems in AI from an algorithm, modeling, system/hardare perspectives, to join us</span> ([DAI-Sys小组招生](https://dai.sjtu.edu.cn/join.html)).
